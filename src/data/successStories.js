    excerpt:
      "Discover how Sompetroleum modernized fuel distribution and billing with an integrated Odoo stack, unlocking real-time visibility across every depot.",
    overview:
      "When Sompetroleum approached HageTech Solutions, their fuel distribution business was running on a patchwork of spreadsheets and disconnected tools. Within six months, we deployed an Odoo platform that unified procurement, inventory, billing, and customer service—creating a single source of truth across 14 depots.",
    challenge:
      "Manual reconciliations and disconnected depot tools led to inventory discrepancies and delayed invoicing. Field teams struggled to provide status updates without a shared system, and finance lacked confidence in monthly numbers.",
    proposition:
      "We rolled out Odoo Inventory with real-time telemetry feeds, introduced automated billing workflows, and connected depot teams with mobile-first apps. Custom dashboards gave leadership instant visibility into stock, deliveries, and revenue.",
    result:
      "Sompetroleum accelerated invoice cycles by 60%, shrank stock variances below 1.5%, and empowered depot managers with on-the-go insights. The new platform now underpins their expansion into two additional regions.",
    body: [
      "Sompetroleum had grown rapidly, but their operational tools had not kept pace. Each depot tracked stock on standalone spreadsheets, depot managers emailed daily updates, and finance teams spent days reconciling numbers at month end.",
      "HageTech Solutions began with a discovery sprint—mapping depot processes, identifying data bottlenecks, and aligning stakeholders on priorities. From there, we introduced a phased rollout of Odoo modules, starting with Inventory and Accounting before extending into CRM and Projects to support expansion initiatives.",
      "Custom integrations pull live readings from depot sensors into Odoo, automating replenishment triggers and alerting managers when discrepancies emerge. Detailed dashboards now give leadership a view of fuel levels, delivery performance, and profitability without waiting for manual reports.",
      "With processes digitized end-to-end, Sompetroleum can scale into new territories confidently. Teams collaborate inside Odoo, service levels have improved, and leadership now plans growth initiatives backed by accurate, real-time data.",

      "How a mission-driven microfinance leader built a compliant Islamic lending platform with offline-first capabilities for rural branches.",
    overview:
      "Somali Microfinance Institution S.C set out to digitize their loan portfolio, but rural branches lacked reliable power and connectivity. Our team blended Odoo microfinance modules, offline-ready infrastructure, and tailored process designs to bring every branch online—without disrupting existing services.",
    challenge:
      "Loan officers relied on paper forms, manual approvals, and limited visibility into customer histories. Remote branches—often operating without stable power—could not access centralized systems, creating delays for clients.",
    proposition:
      "We architected an Odoo-based microfinance suite supporting Murabaha and Musharakah contracts, installed solar power kits and VSAT connectivity, and trained staff with role-based curricula to ensure adoption.",
    result:
      "Branches now originate and approve loans digitally, portfolio tracking accuracy improved by 45%, and customers receive disbursements days faster. The institution can now launch new products with confidence.",
    body: [
      "Inclusive finance requires resilient infrastructure. Somali Microfinance Institution’s leadership understood that modernizing loan management demanded more than software—it required reimagining how branches operated in remote settings.",
      "Through collaborative workshops, we codified their Islamic finance products into Odoo, ensuring every workflow aligned with internal governance and regulatory requirements.",
      "To combat unreliable utilities, we equipped branches with solar power kits and VSAT links, delivering dependable connectivity. Our change management program empowered staff through a blend of train-the-trainer sessions, multilingual guides, and embedded champions.",
      "Today, the institution runs loan origination, approvals, collections, and reporting entirely within Odoo. Leadership monitors portfolio health in real-time while customers experience faster, more transparent service.",

    overview:
      "To meet rising customer expectations, Aaran Hypermarket needed to harmonize in-store and online experiences. We helped them deploy an omnichannel architecture that keeps shelves stocked, shoppers engaged, and finance teams in control.",
    challenge:
      "Outdated POS terminals, manual stock transfers, and disconnected eCommerce tools limited growth. Customers could not rely on online stock levels, and accounting teams spent hours reconciling daily sales.",
    proposition:
      "HageTech Solutions implemented Odoo POS with offline resilience, integrated web storefronts, automated replenishment rules, and centralized loyalty programs spanning every channel.",

    body: [
      "Aaran Hypermarket’s leadership wanted to delight customers with reliable stock information and flexible shopping journeys. But siloed systems and manual reconciliations made accurate inventory nearly impossible.",
      "We introduced barcode-driven POS stations, unified product catalogs across stores and eCommerce, and automated purchase orders based on sales velocity and lead times.",
      "Finance teams benefit from automated end-of-day closings, while marketing runs targeted campaigns using loyalty data captured across every touchpoint.",
      "Customers can order online, reserve for pickup, or shop in-store with consistent pricing and promotions. Executives now track performance metrics via live dashboards, enabling data-backed decisions.",
